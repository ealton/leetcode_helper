Union-Find Algorithm (Disjoint set data structure)
	- detect cycles in city connection problem

Kruskal Algorithm, Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
	- City travel problem
	- sort roads by cost
	- find the minimum spanning tree that connects all nodes
	- use UnionFind to detect cycles

Sparse Table
	- doing efficient range queries on static arrays
	- divide arrays into subsections based on binary (base 2)
	-

Topological Sort
	- takes a directed graph and returns an ordered array of the nodes

	- “Course Schedule”

Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm
	- used to find the majority with at least N/2 occurrences

H-Index
	first H has at least H weights, get max H

KMP and LPS Algorithm (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) and (Longest Prefix Suffix)
	- for search substrings

Total Appeal of a String
	-

Trie (prefix tree)
	-

Edit Distance
	- Levenshtein Distance


Kadane’s Algorithm


Sorts
	- selection sort
	- bubble sort
	- insertion sort
	- heap sort
	- d&v sort (binary sort)

Heap
	- min heap
	- max heap

Graph Algorithm
	- breadth first search
